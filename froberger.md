Background of the Work

Lamento sopra la dolorosa perdita della Real Maestà di Ferdinando IV, FBWV 612, is one of Johann Jakob Froberger’s most expressive and intimate keyboard works.
It was composed around 1657 to mourn the untimely death of Ferdinand IV, King of the Romans and heir to the Holy Roman Empire, who died unexpectedly that same year.
Froberger, who was closely associated with European courts and nobility, composed this Lamento as a deeply personal expression of grief. The work exemplifies his ability to blend emotional depth with musical structure, marking a significant moment in the development of expressive keyboard music during the Baroque period.

Froberger was one of the earliest international composers who fused German, Italian, and French styles, laying the foundation for the keyboard music form of the Baroque era.
In particular, he is known as a pioneer who formalized the order of AleMande, Courante, Sarabande, and Gigue in keyboard collections. He does not just show techniques,
He was a composer who was ahead of his time in that he captured his personal feelings and experiences in music.
Since then, his work has had a great influence on composers such as Coupren and Bach, and plays an important role in understanding the development history of harpsichord and keyboard music even today.
